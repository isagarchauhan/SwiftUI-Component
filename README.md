## 📦 Components Included

### ✅ `CustomSwitch`
A customizable toggle switch with support for color themes, icons, and animations.

### ✅ `WaterFillingView`
This SwiftUI code defines a beautiful animated water fill effect inside a circle, simulating a wave that gradually fills up a container. The animation combines wave motion, fill level progression, and gradient-based styling to create a smooth, visually engaging component.

### ✅ `CircleLoader`
This SwiftUI animation that creates the small circles (it's accept dynamic value) which are moving along the edge of a large circle, with each circle intercepting almost 20% of the other circles, giving continuous rotation, overlapping loader effect based on size of circle. 

### ✅ `MorphCircleView`
Wrapped up a fun little animation in SwiftUI – featuring three morphing, pulsing circles rotating inside a larger circle with a smooth effect. The movement is fully dynamic, with subtle overlaps and seamless transitions.✨
